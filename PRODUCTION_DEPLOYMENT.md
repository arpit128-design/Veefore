# VeeFore Production Deployment Guide

## Fixed Deployment Issues

### 1. MongoDB Storage Compilation Warnings Fixed
- ✅ Removed duplicate `updateWorkspaceCredits` method in `server/mongodb-storage.ts`
- ✅ Cleaned up duplicate class members causing compilation warnings

### 2. Vite Import Handling Fixed
- ✅ Made Vite imports conditional in `server/index.ts` based on NODE_ENV
- ✅ Added production-safe fallback for when Vite dependencies are unavailable
- ✅ Server now gracefully handles missing Vite modules in production

### 3. Production Build Configuration
- ✅ Added health check endpoint at `/api/health` for monitoring
- ✅ Enhanced production static file serving with proper SPA routing
- ✅ Created production build script in `build.production.js`
- ✅ Added multi-stage Dockerfile for containerized deployments

## Quick Deployment Commands

### Build for Production
```bash
# Build client and server for production
npm run build

# Or use the production build script
node build.production.js
```

### Deploy with Docker
```bash
# Build Docker image
docker build -t veefore:latest .

# Run container
docker run -p 5000:5000 --env-file .env veefore:latest
```

### Deploy to Vercel
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm install -g vercel

# Deploy
vercel --prod
```

## Environment Variables Required

Ensure these environment variables are set in your deployment:

```env
# Core Configuration
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=5000

# Database
DATABASE_URL=mongodb://...

# Firebase
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=...
FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY=...
FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL=...

# OpenAI
OPENAI_API_KEY=...

# Stripe
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=...
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=...

# SendGrid
SENDGRID_API_KEY=...

# Instagram
INSTAGRAM_CLIENT_ID=...
INSTAGRAM_CLIENT_SECRET=...

# Other API Keys
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=...
GOOGLE_API_KEY=...
```

## Server Architecture

### Production Mode Features
- **Conditional Vite Loading**: Vite dependencies only loaded in development
- **Graceful Fallbacks**: Static file serving when Vite is unavailable
- **Health Monitoring**: `/api/health` endpoint for uptime checks
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for production failures

### Build Process
1. **Client Build**: Vite builds React app to `dist/public`
2. **Server Build**: esbuild bundles server to `dist/index.js`
3. **Production Package**: Minimal package.json with only production dependencies

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues Fixed

1. **"Vite modules not found"** - ✅ Fixed with conditional imports
2. **"Duplicate class members"** - ✅ Fixed by removing duplicate methods
3. **"Build failed with esbuild errors"** - ✅ Fixed with proper build configuration

### Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Environment variables configured
- [ ] Database connection string updated
- [ ] API keys verified
- [ ] Build completes without errors
- [ ] Health check responds at `/api/health`
- [ ] Static files serve correctly
- [ ] API endpoints respond properly

## Next Steps

1. **Test the Build**: Run `npm run build` to verify compilation
2. **Deploy**: Use your preferred deployment method (Docker, Vercel, etc.)
3. **Monitor**: Check `/api/health` endpoint for system status
4. **Scale**: Configure auto-scaling based on usage patterns

## Production Optimizations Included

- Multi-stage Docker build for smaller image size
- Production-only dependencies in final build
- Proper signal handling with dumb-init
- Health checks for container orchestration
- Static file serving with proper caching headers
- Graceful error handling for missing dependencies

The application is now ready for production deployment with all the suggested fixes implemented.
