âœ… 6. Admin Panel Prompt

Build an admin panel (React + Express) for managing waitlist and early access:

Login-only access for admins (JWT-protected)

Features:

Dashboard of all waitlist users

Filter/sort by referral count, status, credits

One-click upgrade to early_access per user or in bulk

Search and manage top referrers

Send early access emails directly from panel (use nodemailer or Replit-supported email system)

Manually assign rewards or credits if needed

View feedback logs from referred users who completed the 3-day activity requirement

Endpoints:

/api/admin/users â†’ get waitlist users

/api/admin/upgrade-user â†’ upgrade user to early access

/api/admin/send-email â†’ send approval mail with signup link

UI Elements:

Table of waitlist users with status, credits, referrals

Button per row: "Grant Early Access"

Badge for milestone reward levels (e.g., ðŸ’Ž 3+ referrals, ðŸŽ¯ 10+ referrals)

Modal for sending email (autofills name + email)

Working waitlist with referral logic and milestone-based rewards

Gated early access with invite-only approval

30-day free trial for approved users

Advanced referral reward conditions and tracking

Reward popup notifications triggered by referee milestones

Special discount logic for referees (50% off on first paid month)

Referrals increase the user's chance of early access approval

Approval emails with pre-filled signup link (name + email)

Admin dashboard for approvals, reward management, and invite tracking

Beautiful React waitlist section embedded in landing page with referral link sharing and pre-filled user info

All entry points (Sign Up, Get Started, etc.) point to the waitlist form instead of account creation

After early access is granted, revert buttons back to actual signup/login flow
