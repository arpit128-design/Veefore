Social Listening Engine

✅ What it DoesMonitors trends, brand mentions, keywords, and emerging audio/post trends across platforms like Instagram, YouTube, TikTok, and X.

🌐 Feasibility:Moderately feasible with a combination of public data, partner APIs, or scrapers. Limited by platform access.

🔧 Tools & APIs Required:

YouTube Data API (trending videos, comments)

X (Twitter) API v2 (keyword mentions, hashtags)

Instagram Graph API (limited listening via business profiles)

SerpAPI or NewsCatcher (for web monitoring)

Web scraping (optional + risky if not authorized)

🧩 Implementation Strategy:

Define key keywords based on user niche/persona.

Query APIs or scrapers every X minutes for new mentions/trending data.

Feed into AI engine for signal analysis (is it going viral?).

Display live “hot topics,” hashtags, or videos on a dedicated Listening Hub.

Optional: Alert user if their brand is mentioned.

Monitor public posts/comments on Instagram, X, Reddit

Alerts users when:

Someone mentions a competitor

Someone asks for help in their niche

Suggests engaging responses → builds authority → captures leads

Function: Monitor hashtags, keywords in real time

APIs: Twitter (X), Reddit

UI: Terminal-style live feed + filter by sentiment

Content Theft Detection

✅ What it DoesAutomatically adds brand/user-specific watermark or invisible AI fingerprint to content (image/video) before publishing or downloading.

🌐 Feasibility:Highly feasible with watermarking libraries or cloud services.

🔧 Tools & APIs Required:

ffmpeg (for video processing on backend)

sharp (image watermarking)

Cloudinary or Uploadcare (optional for hosted transformations)

Invisible Watermark tools (like Digimarc SDK – optional)

🧩 Implementation Strategy:

Upload user’s watermark/logo at workspace level.

For every AI-generated video/image, apply overlay or invisible watermark.

Store processed versions securely.

Optional: Add metadata (EXIF) with creator handle.

Let user toggle watermarking per post in scheduler.

Watermarks + AI reverse-image detection to track stolen content

Alerts user if their reels/posts are reposted without credit

Function: Detect if user's post is stolen

Tools: TinEye / Azure Vision

Output: Show URLs where content appears
