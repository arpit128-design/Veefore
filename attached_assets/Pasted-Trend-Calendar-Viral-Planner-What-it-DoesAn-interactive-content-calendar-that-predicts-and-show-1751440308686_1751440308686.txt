Trend Calendar & Viral Planner

✅ What it DoesAn interactive content calendar that predicts and showcases upcoming viral trends, seasonal opportunities, platform-specific events, and niche-specific content prompts.

🌐 Feasibility:Highly feasible using a combination of AI + trend scraping. Many platforms already forecast hashtags/events (e.g. Later, Hootsuite).

🔧 Tools & APIs Required:

OpenAI GPT-4 / Gemini (for AI event suggestions)

ExplodingTopics, Trends.co API, or Google Trends (source trends)

Custom scraper (to monitor trending hashtags on IG/X/YouTube)

Your scheduler backend

🧩 Implementation Strategy:

Fetch upcoming public/social events and trending searches.

Map them into a monthly/weekly calendar (per user niche).

Allow users to schedule content directly from trends.

Suggest formats: “Try a reel with this trending sound on Nov 14.”

Update dynamically with orbit-style calendar UI.

Visualized as: A galaxy timeline showing upcoming trends, events, viral challenges.

Data source: Scraped from TikTok, Instagram Reels, Twitter trends, YouTube Shorts.

Use: Plan content ahead around global/niche trends.

Function: Suggest content ideas based on trend dates

UI: Interactive calendar with cosmic pulse highlights on trend-heavy days

API: Google Trends + GPT summarization

A/B Testing Module

✅ What it DoesUsers can test two versions of posts (caption, audio, format) — Metatraq pushes both at staggered times, tracks performance, and auto-suggests the winner.

🌐 Feasibility:Feasible and unique — no major creator tool automates this fully yet. With scheduler + AI analysis, you can stand out.

🔧 Tools & APIs Required:

AI engine (to analyze results)

Native post scheduler (already in your app)

Instagram/YouTube publish API (for automation)

Charting tool (Recharts or D3)

MongoDB (store A/B test logs)

🧩 Implementation Strategy:

User uploads A and B variants (caption/media).

Metatraq posts both at ideal times.

Track engagement over X hours (likes/comments/views).

AI compares performance → flags winner.

Auto-save best post format for future reuse.

How it works: Schedule a post → test 2–3 versions of captions or hashtags on small audience segment → best performer gets published fully.

Powered by: Micro-targeting and AI analysis.

Why it helps: Boosts reach through data-driven creativity.

Function: Post two versions of content and compare performance

Frontend: Side-by-side comparison UI

Backend: /api/ab-test

Logic: Shows better-performing post after 48h
