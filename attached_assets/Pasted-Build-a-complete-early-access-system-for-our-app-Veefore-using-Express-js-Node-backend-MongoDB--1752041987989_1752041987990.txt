Build a complete early access system for our app (Veefore) using Express.js (Node backend), MongoDB, and React frontend on Replit.

This system must include:

✅ 1. Waitlist + Referral System

Create an API endpoint /api/waitlist/join to accept the following:

Name

Email

Optional ref query param (referral code)

On join:

Generate a unique referralCode for each user (6-character string)

Store the user in MongoDB with:

email, name, referralCode, referredBy, referralCount (default 0), credits (default 0), status (default: waitlisted), createdAt

If the user was referred (ref is present):

Increment the referralCount of the referrer

Logic:

1st referral → +10 credits

2nd referral → +20 credits

3rd referral → +1 month Pro plan (total 2 months)

4th referral onward → +40 credits per successful refer

A referral is only rewarded when:

The referred person signs up or joins the waitlist using the referral code or referral link

If that referred user gets approved for early access, they must:

Open the app daily for 3 days

Submit feedback on Day 3

Then the referrer receives a popup confirming their reward

Special popup is shown for the 1-month Pro Plan reward at 3 referrals

🎯 Every referral a user makes increases their chance of receiving early access approval, even if it's just one referral. This applies in addition to all listed rewards and incentives.

✅ 2. Waitlist Landing Page (React UI Prompt)

The waitlist form should be prominently shown on the landing page (/) of the app.

All "Sign Up", "Sign In", and "Get Started" buttons across the site should scroll to or open the waitlist form instead of starting account creation.

❗ Once a user is upgraded to early_access, the app should update the interface dynamically:

Replace the Join Waitlist button with original Sign Up, Sign In, and Get Started buttons

These buttons should redirect to the actual signup or login pages (/signup, /login)

This ensures approved users no longer see the waitlist form

Build a beautiful waitlist section using React + Tailwind CSS

Features:

Form fields:

Full Name (required)

Email (required)

Referral Code (optional)

On successful submission:

Display user’s unique referral code (referralCode)

Show copyable direct referral link: https://veefore.com?ref=abc123

Include share buttons:

WhatsApp: https://wa.me/?text=Check%20this%20out%3A%20https%3A%2F%2Fveefore.com%3Fref%3Dabc123

Instagram DM (copy message + link)

SMS (deep link: sms:?body=Join%20Veefore%20Early%20Access%20https://veefore.com?ref=abc123)

After joining, users see:

"🎉 Thanks for joining the waitlist, [Name]! Here’s your referral code: abc123. Share this link to earn rewards and early access."

Track how many people they’ve referred (via /api/user/me)

Responsive design, clean layout, animated confirmation UI

✅ 3. Early Access Gating

Only allow users with status: 'early_access' or 'launched' to access the app features

Users with status waitlisted should be blocked and shown a message:

“You’re on the waitlist! Early access launching soon.”

Provide an admin-only endpoint /api/user/upgrade-access to manually upgrade selected waitlisted users to early_access

⚠️ Bypass logic: allow users with Google login using either of these email addresses to access the app anytime regardless of status:

arpitchoudhary8433@gmail.com

choudharyarpit977@gmail.com

✅ 4. Free Pro Trial System

When a user is upgraded to early access:

Set trialExpiresAt = Date.now + 30 days (1 month)

Set plan = 'starter'

Referred users who join via referral code or link and later get approved:

Also receive 30 days Starter Plan free (waitlist bonus)

Additionally, they receive:

+20 credits bonus

A one-time 50% off discount on their 2nd month Starter Plan

This discount is only valid on their first purchase after the 1-month trial

Discount is valid for 14 days after the trial ends — expires after that

Only applicable to Starter Plan tier

On each login:

Check if trialExpiresAt < Date.now()

If true → downgrade plan to free

On the frontend:

Show trial countdown: “🕒 You have X days left in your Pro trial”

Show referral link: https://veefore.com?ref=abc123

Show referral progress, credits earned, pending rewards

Popups to confirm reward received based on actions completed by referees

✅ 5. Pre-Filled Signup via Approval Email

When a user is approved for early access, send them a custom signup link:
https://veefore.com/signup?email=user@example.com&name=JohnDoe

On the frontend signup page, use the email and name query parameters to auto-fill the respective fields using React’s useSearchParams() hook.

Backend must validate that the email exists in the database and is marked as early_access before allowing account creation.

Example user experience:

User clicks approval link from email

Arrives on /signup with email and name pre-filled

Completes signup form (password, confirm name/email if needed)

Gains access immediately since they were already approved

✅ 6. Admin Panel Prompt

Build an admin panel (React + Express) for managing waitlist and early access:

Login-only access for admins (JWT-protected)

Features:

Dashboard of all waitlist users

Filter/sort by referral count, status, credits

One-click upgrade to early_access per user or in bulk

Search and manage top referrers

Send early access emails directly from panel (use nodemailer or Replit-supported email system)

Manually assign rewards or credits if needed

View feedback logs from referred users who completed the 3-day activity requirement

Endpoints:

/api/admin/users → get waitlist users

/api/admin/upgrade-user → upgrade user to early access

/api/admin/send-email → send approval mail with signup link

UI Elements:

Table of waitlist users with status, credits, referrals

Button per row: "Grant Early Access"

Badge for milestone reward levels (e.g., 💎 3+ referrals, 🎯 10+ referrals)

Modal for sending email (autofills name + email)

✅ 7. APIs to Implement

✅ 8. Tech Stack Requirements

Backend: Express.js + MongoDB + JWT auth

Frontend: React (Admin Panel and Signup/Waitlist pages)

Deployment: Replit (Replit secrets for DB connection)

Database: MongoDB collection waitlist_users

📌 Expected Output

Working waitlist with referral logic and milestone-based rewards

Gated early access with invite-only approval

30-day free trial for approved users

Advanced referral reward conditions and tracking

Reward popup notifications triggered by referee milestones

Special discount logic for referees (50% off on first paid month)

Referrals increase the user's chance of early access approval

Approval emails with pre-filled signup link (name + email)

Admin dashboard for approvals, reward management, and invite tracking

Beautiful React waitlist section embedded in landing page with referral link sharing and pre-filled user info

All entry points (Sign Up, Get Started, etc.) point to the waitlist form instead of account creation

After early access is granted, revert buttons back to actual signup/login flow
