## 🧠 STAGE 2: Vision-to-Design Match (Style AI + Trending Sync)

### What it does:
- Scrapes top 50–100 trending thumbnails from YouTube + Instagram
- Extracts both visual features and title context
- Uses CLIP/BLIP to embed both visual and text together
- Compares user video’s content to this “style vector” to:
  - Match high-performing thumbnails
  - Suggest trending layout patterns
  - Suggest badge style, emoji, shadow, stroke, filter combos

### Stack:
- Puppeteer for scraping (or YouTube Data API)
- OpenAI CLIP or BLIP-2 model for similarity
- Store vectors in vector DB (Pinecone/Weaviate)
- Match input title + image to best design archetypes

### Output:
```json
{
  "matched_trend_thumbnail": "https://yt.com/trend123.jpg",
  "layout_style": "Z-pattern-left-face",
  "visual_motif": "zoomed face + glow + red stroke",
  "emoji": ["🔥", "😱"],
  "filters": ["vibrance", "warm_tone"]
}
```

Feed this into canvas generator for AI-based visual composition.
