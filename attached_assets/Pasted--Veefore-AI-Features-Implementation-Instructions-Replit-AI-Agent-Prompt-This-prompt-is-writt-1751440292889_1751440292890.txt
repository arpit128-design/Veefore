🧠 Core AI Features 

Creative Brief Generator

✅ What it DoesThis AI-powered feature generates structured creative briefs for campaigns, posts, or reels — including tone, target audience, platforms, formats, and deadlines.

🌐 Feasibility:Highly feasible with current LLMs (like GPT-4, Gemini, Claude). Many brands already use similar features via Notion AI or Copy.ai.

🔧 Tools & APIs Required:

OpenAI GPT-4 / Gemini Pro / Claude (for brief generation)

LangChain / PromptFlow (for structured AI workflow)

MongoDB (store user campaigns)

Optional: Notion API (to export briefs)

🧩 Implementation Strategy:

Add a form asking: audience, goals, platforms, style, etc.

Prompt your LLM with structured output (Markdown/JSON brief).

Store brief in user’s workspace project.

Add “Export” option (PDF/Notion/email).

Credit deduction per generation.

Function: Generate structured content plans from user goals.

Backend Route: POST /api/brief

AI API: OpenAI GPT-4 (or Gemini Pro/claude)

Frontend: Cosmic-themed form for inputs like tone, platform, audience. Output as glowing animated content card.

DB: Save brief, goals, persona, generatedAt, userId, workspaceId

Multi-Language Content Repurposing

✅ What it DoesAutomatically rewrites captions, post content, or reels in multiple languages optimized for tone, cultural nuance, and social trends.

🌐 Feasibility:Very feasible. AI translation + tone tuning works well using OpenAI, DeepL, or Google Cloud Translation.

🔧 Tools & APIs Required:

OpenAI GPT-4 Turbo (multi-language rewriting)

Google Cloud Translation API or DeepL

LanguageDetector or FastText (detect source language)

Your MongoDB database for storing multilingual content

🧩 Implementation Strategy:

User uploads or selects content → asks for repurposing.

Detect source language, then prompt AI to rewrite in target.

Localize tone and idioms for region (e.g., Spanish-MX vs. ES).

Show real-time preview and allow user edits.

Add bulk mode for agencies and credits per repurposed post.

What it does: AI translates + localizes captions, hashtags, and even voiceovers for reels/videos.

Use case: Helps creators expand to international audiences effortlessly.

Add-on: Text-to-speech in native accents with AI dubbing.

Function: Translate and culturally adapt existing content.

APIs: Google Translate + OpenAI

UI: Source panel → Target panel with preview & tweak

Usage: Converts 1 post using 3 credits

Competitor Analysis Engine

What it DoesAnalyzes competitors’ public Instagram or YouTube content to highlight trends, viral posts, hashtags, formats, posting times, etc.

🌐 Feasibility:Moderately feasible. Instagram has strict API access, but public data scraping (via Puppeteer/SerpAPI) and YouTube Data API make this possible.

🔧 Tools & APIs Required:

YouTube Data API (for competitor channels)

SerpAPI or ScrapeNinja (Instagram public data)

MongoDB or PostgreSQL (store scraped data)

LLM (GPT-4) to summarize and visualize trends

Chart.js or Recharts (display insights)

🧩 Implementation Strategy:

Ask user to enter competitor usernames.

Use API/scraper to fetch recent public posts.

Analyze metrics: likes/comments, hashtags, format, captions.

Run AI summarization: “Top performing format: Reels with 20–30s, humor + trending audio.”

Display in orbital UI + recommendations for user content.

Function: User enters competitor handle → AI scrapes & analyzes their top-performing content.

Output: Trend patterns, best time to post, content types that work, engagement style.

Bonus: Suggests how to outperform them.

Function: Monitor and compare public data of competitor handles.

Frontend: Type username → Shows growth rate, content performance

Backend: /api/competitor with public scraper or APIs like SocialBlade
